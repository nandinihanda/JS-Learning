const myarr=[0,1,2,3,4,5] //array with numbers

const myarr1=["apple","mango","grapes"] //string array

const myarr2=new Array(1,2,3,4) //another way of declaring an array
console.log(myarr[1]) //fetching the element of array through index number

//Array methods

myarr.push(6)//add elements at the end of array
console.log(myarr);

myarr.pop() //remove the last elememnt of the array

myarr.unshift(12)//add elements at the start of array
myarr.shift() //remove the first elememnt of the array

console.log(myarr.includes(9));
console.log(myarr.indexOf(3));

//join method joins anything with the array and also converts the array into string

//slice and splice methods

//slice method does not manipulates the original array while splice method manipulates the original array.
